# Why

Here are scripts for managing the Postgres database using podman on
Fedora Linux.

The scripts are written in Python to promote readability, though the same
functionality could have been performed in Bash or some other POSIX shell.

Consequently, the scripts are ran with 

```
python my_script.py
```

# Also Included

is a script to convert the csv file in this folder to some python objects
for easier manipulation.
