# Why

Here are scripts for managing the Postges database using podman on
Fedora Linux.

The scripts are written in Python to promote readability, though the same
functionality could have been performed in Bash or some other POSIX shell.

Consequently, the scripts are ran with 

```
python my_script.py
```
